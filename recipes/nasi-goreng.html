    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The literal translation of Nasi Goreng is “fried rice” in Indonesian and Malaysian – and that’s exactly what it is! It’s mainly rice with just a little bit of meat and just onion for the vegetables. The thing that distinguishes it from other Fried Rice dishes is the sauce which is made with kecap manis, a sweet soy sauce that stains the rice dark brown and caramelises the rice when it cooks.

    Typically it’s served with a sunny side up egg (love how the yolk runs into the rice!) and a side of fresh cucumber and tomato (no dressing) to make a meal of it.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>4 cups cold cooked jasmine rice (21 ounces; 600g) or other medium- to long-grain rice</li> 
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) neutral oil, such as canola or sunflower oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) kecap manis (see note), plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons (10ml) soy sauce</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Ground white pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If using day-old rice, transfer rice to a bowl and break rice up with your hands into individual grains.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add spice paste and cook, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the wok or pan to prevent the paste from burning, until a pungent smell permeates your kitchen and the paste turns a few shades darker, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium at any time if the paste appears to be browning too quickly.</li>
        <li>Add rice to the wok and stir to coat with the spice paste. Add kecap manis and soy sauce. Stir and cook until rice is evenly colored and hot throughout. Season with salt and white pepper.</li>
        <li>Divide rice between two plates and top each plate of rice with a fried egg. Garnish with cucumber and tomato slices and shower with fried shallots, if you like. Serve immediately with kecap manis alongside for drizzling.</li>
    </ol>
