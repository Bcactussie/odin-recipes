    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Long before kale became the popular "superfood," it was already a much-used ingredient in the Dutch winter kitchen, where it's known as boerenkool, or "farmer's cabbage." Most emblematic of all is its use is in this traditional boerenkoolstamppot met rookworst aka stamppot, which arguably could be considered the Netherlands' national dish.</p>
<p>This is Dutch comfort cooking—mashed potatoes and curly kale are served with a Dutch smoked sausage, known as rookworst. In strictly traditional recipes, the boerenkool is boiled, but this recipe calls for sautéeing the curly kale in a little olive oil to keep its color, texture, and flavor intact. You can use a bag of pre-cut curly kale or bunches fresh from the garden. If you can't find rookworst where you live (you can order Dutch products online), use kielbasa instead.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>3 1/3 pounds (1 1/2 kilograms) floury potatoes (such as russet and Yukon Gold) </li>
        <li>2 bay leaves </li>
        <li>2  cups (475 milliliters) milk </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided </li>
        <li>Pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly ground pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 2/3 pounds (750 grams) curly kale</li>
        <li>2 shallots</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>2 links rookworsten (smoked sausage), warmed and sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. </li>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces for even cooking.</li>
        <li>In a large soup pot, boil the potatoes and the bay leaves in salted water for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, warm the milk in a pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>When the potatoes are done cooking, drain, shake dry, discard bay leaves, and return to pot.</li>
        <li>Mash with a potato masher, or for a smoother consistency use a potato ricer. Add the warm milk and 2 tablespoons of the butter. Season to taste with the nutmeg, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Trim any coarse stems and discard any brown leaves from the kale. With a sharp knife, cut the curly kale into thin strips.</li>
        <li>Peel and chop the shallots.</li>
        <li>In a frying pan or skillet, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter.</li>
        <li>Sauté the shallots for about 2 minutes, until translucent and starting to become golden.</li>
        <li>Add the curly kale and the water. Season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Mix the cooked curly kale through the mashed potatoes.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving dish. Top with the slices of the warm smoked sausage. Serve hot with your favorite mustard or gravy.</li>
