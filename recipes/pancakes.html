    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A pannenkoek (plural pannenkoeken and pannekoek in Old Dutch) is a pancake that comes from the Netherlands. They are typically large, whole-pan size and are much thinner than a traditional American pancake (but not quite as thin as a French crepe). </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li> 2 Eggs </li>
        <li>2 C Milk </li>
        <li>1.5 Teaspoons of Salt </li>
        <li>2 C All-purpose-flour</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the egg until slightly foamy. Add the milk and salt, whisking to combine. Add the flour, slowly, whisking as you add, until the batter is smooth. </li>
        <li>Heat a 10 inch skillet over medium heat. Add a little butter to coat the skillet. </li>
        <li>Add Â½ cup of batter to the pan and swirl it around to coat the pan. (If using add-ins, sprinkle them over top of the wet batter.) Cook the pannekoek over medium heat until it is just getting dry on the top and releases from the pan, 2-3 minutes. </li>
        <li>Flip the pannenkoek and cook for 1-2 minute on the second side, until lightly golden. </li>
        <li>Remove the pannenkoek from the plan and place on a platter. Keep your stack of pannekoeken warm in a warm oven while you coat the skillet again with butter and cook up the rest of the batter.</li>
    </ol>
